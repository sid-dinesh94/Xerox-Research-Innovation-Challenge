# Xerox Research Innovation Challenge
All work for the Xerox Research Innovation Challenge 2015 in the month of October 2015.
The four python files constitute our four attempted solutions to the problem given.
The Data has not been shared on github. It is downloaded from the Competition website, here: https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/xerox-research-innovation-challenge-2015/challenges/xerox-predict-mortality

The ipython notebooks are where we tried out our ideas and did a rough run through of our strategies for Preprocessing, Feature Extraction, Validation, and Grid Search of the optimal parameters. 

Our final classifer for predicting the mortality of patients in the ICU given their vital readings and lab results in a time series format used a bagged classifier in order to maintain 99% sensitivity with a competitive sensitivity.
